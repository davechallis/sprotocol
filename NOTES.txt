Design Specification for the API: 

genericQuery(String query) should return a object of class: AnyResult. 

The Class AnyResult should have the following functions: 

getType() -> returns one of an Enumerated Classes
getSelectResult() -> returns something similar to the MySql SelectResult thing
getConstructResult() -> returns a String 
getAskResult() -> returns a boolean

And then we should have more specific functions which people can use if they feel like it : 

SelectResultSet executeSelect() 
boolean executeAsk()
String executeConstruct()

And I should move the SPARQL Endpoint to the constructor, as people are more likely to be SPARQLing a given endpoint as apposed to lots of different ones
